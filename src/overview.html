<BODY>
The OLM is one of the component of the Extended Learner Model (xLM), the prototype learner
modelling subsystem of LeActiveMath. Its aim it to provide LeActiveMath with an interface
for the learners to access, explore and challenge the judgments that the xLM is holding about
them. It supports several external representations for displaying the various sources of information
that the xLM is using to establish its judgement (belief, evidence, etc.) and a mechanism - loosely
based on Toulmin Argumentation Pattern - to control the exploration and negotiation of the
beliefs. 

<P>

The OLM is implemented as a SWING applet, using the powerful resources of this Java
GUI library in order to provide a suitable and usable interface for the learners.
