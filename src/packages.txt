/** @mainpage Open Learner Model - GUI

The OLM is one of the component of the Extended Learner Model (xLM), the prototype learner
modelling subsystem of LeActiveMath. Its aim it to provide LeActiveMath with an interface
for the learners to access, explore and challenge the judgments that the xLM is holding about
them. It supports several external representations for displaying the various sources of information
that the xLM is using to establish its judgement (belief, evidence, etc.) and a mechanism - loosely
based on Toulmin Argumentation Pattern - to control the exploration and negotiation of the
beliefs. 

<P>

The OLM is implemented as a SWING applet, using the powerful resources of this Java
GUI library in order to provide a suitable and usable interface for the learners.

/** @package dialogue
	@brief This package contains all the classes required for managing the dialogue between
		   the learner and the OLM
		   
    The package consists in several classes implementing the various moves that can be played 
	either by the OLM or the learner, as well as the handler for the current dialogue move.		 

	@todo It will be a good idea to look at some FSM implementation to have an alternative to this 
		  hand-made system (check http://smc.sourceforge.net/ for example).

/** @package olmgui
	@brief This package contains the implementation of the Graphical User Interface of the 
	Open Learner Model.

/** @package olmgui.graph
	@brief This package contains the classes used to display and manipulate the topic maps 
	and the Toulmin Argumentation Pattern.

/** @package olmgui.i18n
	@brief This package contains the classes supporting the internationalisation of the OLM.

Languages currently supported by the OLM are:
 - English (default) in the file <code>messages.properties</code>
 - Spanish in the file <code>messages_es.properties</code>
 - French in the file <code>messages_fr.properties</code>
 - German in the file <code>messages_de.properties</code>


The files contains key/value pairs of string. The keys are organised according to 
the following pattern:

 - <code>DlgErrorMsg</code> refers to the various error or warning messages used 
	by the OLM. Subkeys are used mostly for convenience.
 - <code>DlgMove</code> refers to the templates used to transcribe the dialogue moves,
	played either by the user or the OLM, in the Dialogue View. Subkeys are used to 
	identify individual dialogue moves and the context in which they occur.
 - <code>Metadata</code> refers to the translation of the various information coming 
	from LeAM such as the parameters and values of the events. Subkeys correspond to  
	the various attributes extracted from the evidence, as described in 
	{@link config.OLMQueryResult}.<BR>
	Attributes subkeys could have subkeys themselves, indicating the possible values 
	that the attribute could take (and their transcription). See 
	{@link toulmin.ToulminAttribute} for more information about the transcription of 
	event's attributes.
 - <code>OLMChallengePane</code> contains the strings used in the various widgets of 
	the Challenge GUI.
 - <code>OLMConfig</code> contains various strings used to configure the OLM.
 - <code>OLMGraphBrowser</code> 
 - <code>OLMMainGUI</code> 
 - <code>OLMMoveSelector</code> 
 - <code>OLMTopicConfig</code> 
 - <code>OLMTopicConfig</code>
