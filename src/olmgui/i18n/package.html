This package contains the classes supporting the internationalisation of the OLM.

<P>Languages currently supported by the OLM are:

<UL>
<LI> English (default) in the file <code>messages.properties</code>
<LI> Spanish in the file <code>messages_es.properties</code>
<LI> French in the file <code>messages_fr.properties</code>
<LI> German in the file <code>messages_de.properties</code>
</UL>


<P>The files contains key/value pairs of string. The keys are organised according to 
the following pattern:

<UL>
<LI><code>DlgErrorMsg</code> refers to the various error or warning messages used 
	by the OLM. Subkeys are used mostly for convenience.
	
<LI><code>DlgMove</code> refers to the templates used to transcribe the dialogue moves
	- played either by the user or the OLM - in the Dialogue View. Subkeys are used to 
	identify individual dialogue moves and the context in which they occur.

<LI><code>Metadata</code> refers to the traduction of the various information coming 
	from LeAM such as the parameters and values of the events. Subkeys correspond to  
	the various attributes extracted from the evidence, as described in 
	{@link config.OLMQueryResult}.<BR>
	Attributes subkeys could have subkeys themselves, indicating the possible values 
	that the attribute could take (and their transcription). See 
	{@link toulmin.ToulminAttribute} for more information about the transcription of 
	event's attributes.

	the Challenge GUI.
